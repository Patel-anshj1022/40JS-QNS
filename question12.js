//Question 12 : What will the following code output, and why?
//console.log(2 + "2");
//console.log(2 - "2");
//Answer : (22): The + operator in JavaScript is overloaded. When one operand is a string, it triggers string concatenation.
//Answer : (0): The - operator is strictly for numeric subtraction. When one operand is not a number, JavaScript tries to coerce the operand to a number.
